## Question #1

In the [chapter 4](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/chapter-4-summary-and-quiz/) comprehensive quiz, we wrote a program to simulate a ball falling off of a tower. Because we didn’t have loops yet, the ball could only fall for 5 seconds.

Take the program below and modify it so that the ball falls for as many seconds as needed until it reaches the ground.
