## Question #2

Create a struct to hold a fraction. The struct should have an integer numerator and an integer denominator member.

Write a function to read in a Fraction from the user, and use it to read-in two fraction objects. Write another function to multiply two Fractions together and return the result as a Fraction (you don’t need to reduce the fraction). Write another function that prints a fraction.

Your program’s output should match the following:
```bash
Enter a value for the numerator: 1
Enter a value for the denominator: 2

Enter a value for the numerator: 3
Enter a value for the denominator: 4

Your fractions multiplied together: 3/8
```

When multiplying two fractions together, the resulting numerator is the product of the two numerators, and the resulting denominator is the product of the two denominators.
