## Question #1

- [Chapter13 passing and returning structs](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/passing-and-returning-structs/)

You are running a website, and you are trying to calculate your advertising revenue. Write a program that allows you to enter 3 pieces of data:

- How many ads were watched.
- What percentage of users clicked on an ad.
- The average earnings per clicked ad.

Store those 3 values in a struct. Pass that struct to another function that prints each of the values. The print function should also print how much you made for that day (multiply the 3 fields together).
